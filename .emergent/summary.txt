The AI engineer's work primarily focused on integrating audio, rectifying database inconsistencies, and refining content. Key efforts included installing  and creating  for authentic audio playback. Significant time was spent resolving persistent database issues, including using the correct 548-word database instead of the 463-word version, and ensuring maéva replaced djalabé. Extensive emoji cleanup was performed, removing ambiguous and incorrect associations (e.g., papaye with mango). The work was iterative, often involving script creation for database manipulation and frontend updates for UI integration. The most recent task involves diagnosing a Construire des phrases game bug where it gets stuck loading.

The user requires an educational mobile application for children to learn Shimaoré and Kibouchi, featuring engaging games, illustrations, audio pronunciation, an admin panel, offline mode, badge system, and user data export. The core problem has been continuous refinement of vocabulary, ensuring accurate translations, correct orthography, and proper category management.

Explicit requests throughout the trajectory included:
1.  **UI/UX Optimization**: Refine Quiz Mayotte and Mémoire des fleurs layouts for mobile, including responsive game entries, texts, buttons, and vertical alignment of score counters.
2.  **Content Visualization (Emojis)**: Implement small, pretty symbols (emojis) for vocabulary items, strictly for clear and exact meanings, replacing generic images.
3.  **Database Integrity & Restoration**: Critically, verify and restore the correct 548-word authentic database, eliminate duplicates, ensure translations like maéva are used instead of djalabé, and prevent usage of incorrect data sources.
4.  **New Game - Construire des phrases**: Implement a fourth game focused on sentence reconstruction using a database of conjugated verbs (Shimaoré, Kibouchi, French) across various tenses.
5.  **French Conjugation Improvement**: Ensure grammatical correctness in French sentences, including contractions and proper past/future tense conjugations.
6.  **Audio Pronunciation (Voix Off)**: Integrate a system for reading words/expressions in French, Shimaoré, and Kibouchi, prioritizing user-provided authentic audio recordings with text-to-speech fallback, and size-optimized audio files.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was addressing a critical bug in the Construire des phrases game. The user reported that the game was stuck on chargement des phrases (loading phrases) and they could not test its content. This indicates a potential issue with the frontend's ability to fetch sentences from the backend or a problem with the backend's  endpoint itself. The AI engineer's last action was to begin diagnosing this problem by checking the status of the backend server and specifically inspecting the  endpoint to determine the root cause of the loading issue.
