The AI engineer iteratively built and refined an Expo mobile application for learning Shimaoré and Kibouchi. Initial efforts established a full-stack architecture and core learning modules. Much of the work involved meticulous content management, primarily through user-provided vocabulary tables for various categories (animals, body parts, food, nature, adjectives, expressions, house, transport, clothing, tradition). The AI consistently updated the backend (), often replacing entire sections or adding new entries, and then integrated new categories into the frontend navigation (, ). Recurring challenges included duplicate data entries in the backend and frontend display issues (like a missing tradition menu, which required troubleshooting to resolve a Metro bundler  flag). The AI also handled an Expo SDK compatibility issue, downgrading to the latest stable version. The work demonstrates a pattern of rapid iteration, detailed content correction, and persistent debugging to meet precise user specifications.

<product_requirements>
The user requested an educational mobile application for children to learn Shimaoré and Kibouchi, languages of Mayotte. The app needs engaging games, illustrations, audio/pronunciation for words, and an admin panel for content management. Design must be user-friendly, original, and culturally specific to Mayotte (yellow/black, ylang-ylang, makis motifs). Key features added post-initial build include offline mode, a badge/reward system, and user data export. The primary ongoing request is the continuous update and refinement of vocabulary across numerous categories. This involves adding new words, correcting Shimaoré/Kibouchi translations, rectifying French orthography, and managing word categories based on detailed tables provided by the user. The goal is linguistic accuracy and comprehensive content.

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **Full-stack Development**: Expo (React Native) frontend, FastAPI backend, MongoDB database.
-   **Expo Router**: File-based navigation.
-   **Content Management**: Dynamic vocabulary categories stored in MongoDB via FastAPI.
-   **Frontend State**:  for local data persistence.
-   **Build Process**: Metro bundler (Expo's JavaScript bundler).
-   **Troubleshooting**: Diagnosis of build/caching issues.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application follows a standard Expo full-stack architecture:



-   :
    -   **Importance**: Central to the application's data and logic, handling all content definitions and API endpoints.
    -   **Changes Made**: Heavily modified throughout the trajectory. It was initially populated with base vocabulary (greetings, colors, numbers, family, grammar, verbs, animals). Subsequent changes involved:
        -   Replacing and correcting the  list multiple times, fixing duplicates (e.g., Escargot), and adding new species (totaling 65 animals).
        -   Replacing and correcting the  section (32 parts).
        -   Replacing and correcting the  section (43 items).
        -   Replacing and correcting the  section (49 elements).
        -   Creating and correcting a new  section (52 adjectives).
        -   Creating and correcting a new  section (44 expressions).
        -   Adding professions to the  section (21 elements).
        -   Renaming, reverting, replacing, and adding to the  section (now 42 elements after deletions).
        -   Replacing and correcting the  section (7 items).
        -   Replacing and correcting the  section (16 items).
        -   Creating a new  section (16 cultural elements).
        -   Adding specific verbs and correcting others (128 verbs in total).
        -   Numerous orthographical corrections for Shimaoré, Kibouchi, and French.
-   :
    -   **Importance**: Defines the categories displayed in the main learning screen.
    -   **Changes Made**: Updated to dynamically include newly added categories: , , . The  category was also re-integrated after being temporarily replaced by .
-   :
    -   **Importance**: Provides an interface for content administration, which depends on the defined categories.
    -   **Changes Made**: Similar to , updated to include , , and  in its category list. The  category was also re-integrated.
-   :
    -   **Importance**: Manages project dependencies and SDK versions for the Expo frontend.
    -   **Changes Made**: Modified to attempt an upgrade to Expo SDK 54, then reverted and optimized for the latest stable version, Expo SDK 53.0.22, along with compatible React Native and Expo Router versions.
-   :
    -   **Importance**: Contains environment variables crucial for Expo's operation.
    -   **Changes Made**: Briefly inspected for a  flag which was identified as causing bundling issues; the flag was removed to ensure proper frontend reloading.
</code_architecture>

<pending_tasks>
-   Full implementation of native audio for Shimaoré/Kibouchi pronunciation.
-   Resolution of all identified duplicate entries in the backend (e.g., in Corps humain, Verbes, Maison, Poisson, Pirogue).
-   User-reported bug:  during a verb correction (Chat 453).
-   Frontend mobile UI testing to verify all recent vocabulary updates and corrections across all categories.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was engaged in a series of content corrections and deletions based on explicit user requests. Specifically, the following actions were performed:
1.  **Deletion of sot**: The French word sot was removed from the  section in .
2.  **Correction of torche locale**: The entry for torche locale in the  section was updated with new Shimaoré (gandilé/poutourmax) and Kibouchi (poutourmax) translations.
3.  **Correction of plateau**: The entry for plateau in the  section was updated with new Shimaoré (bandra) and Kibouchi (kètraka) translations.
4.  **Deletion of route**: The French word route was removed from the  section.
After each of these edits, the AI restarted the backend service. The trajectory concludes immediately after the backend restart following the deletion of route from the  section, without a final backend test summary for these specific changes or a frontend restart/test. The overall application currently contains 575 words across 16 categories.

<optional_next_step>
Perform a backend test to verify the latest corrections and deletions in the maison and nature sections.
