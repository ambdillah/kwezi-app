The AI engineer's work in this trajectory primarily focused on refining the user interface of two learning games (Quiz Mayotte and M√©moire des fleurs) and revamping the visual representation of vocabulary items in the backend. The initial phase involved troubleshooting and fixing layout issues on mobile screens for Quiz Mayotte, which included adjusting Flexbox properties and text sizes. This iterative process involved inspecting code, taking screenshots for verification, and restarting the frontend multiple times to ensure changes propagated. A similar approach was then applied to M√©moire des fleurs, successfully resolving identical layout problems. Finally, the user requested a shift from external image URLs to emojis for vocabulary representation, which the AI implemented in the backend by updating  with appropriate emojis for various word categories. The work concluded with these emoji replacements being made and the intent to test them.

<product_requirements>
The user requires an educational mobile application for children to learn Shimaor√© and Kibouchi, the languages of Mayotte, featuring engaging games, illustrations, audio pronunciation, an admin panel, offline mode, badge system, and user data export. The primary ongoing need is the continuous refinement of vocabulary, including adding words, correcting translations, rectifying French orthography, and managing categories. Earlier work included implementing alphabetical/numerical sorting and developing three interactive games: a translation quiz, a memory game, and a cultural quiz. Image and native audio pronunciation integration were also requested.

In this trajectory, specific requests included:
1.  **UI Fix for Quiz Mayotte**: The Quiz Mayotte game's start screen (title, description, and Commencer button) did not fit correctly on phone screens and was misaligned. The request was to re-arrange elements for proper display.
2.  **UI Fix for M√©moire des fleurs**: Similar to Quiz Mayotte, the M√©moire des fleurs game's start screen elements (title, description, button) were misaligned and did not fit well on mobile screens, specifically the button being offset. The request was to apply similar layout optimizations.
3.  **Content Visualization Change**: Replace existing image URLs for vocabulary words with small, pretty symbols (emojis) in various categories like maison, plage, foret, etc., to enhance visual coherence and efficiency.

<code_architecture>
The application follows a standard Expo full-stack architecture:



-   :
    -   **Importance**: Handles all data and API logic, serving vocabulary content.
    -   **Changes Made**: Previously updated to include  and  fields. In this trajectory, the  values for 23 specific words across various categories (Couleurs, Animaux, Nombres, Corps, Maison, Nature) were updated from image URLs to appropriate Unicode emojis (e.g., Maison now uses üè†, Plage uses üèñÔ∏è).
-   :
    -   **Importance**: Contains the logic and UI for all interactive learning games, including Quiz Mayotte and M√©moire des fleurs.
    -   **Changes Made**: Extensively modified to optimize the start screens for both Quiz Mayotte and M√©moire des fleurs for mobile display. New , , , ,  styles were added, replacing problematic  layouts. Similar styles (, , etc.) were introduced for M√©moire des fleurs to center content, adjust font sizes, and make buttons more accessible.
-   :
    -   **Importance**: Manages frontend dependencies and Expo SDK version.
    -   **Changes Made**: No direct changes were noted in this trajectory, but it defines the environment.
-   :
    -   **Importance**: Holds environment variables for Expo.
    -   **Changes Made**: No direct changes were made to the variables, but it's critical for environment configuration.

    -   **Importance**: TypeScript configuration for the frontend.
    -   **Changes Made**: No direct changes were noted in this trajectory.

<pending_tasks>
-   Implement frontend UI for audio playback to enable children to listen to word pronunciations.
-   Develop and integrate a personal word mastery system (e.g., clickable stars/colors).
-   Implement full support for multiple audio pronunciations per word (e.g., Shimaor√© and Kibouchi for Papa).
-   Extend image/icon coverage to a broader range of vocabulary words across all categories (now with emojis).
-   Conduct comprehensive frontend mobile UI testing on Expo Go for all implemented features and content updates, specifically for the newly added emojis.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer successfully implemented the user's request to replace image URLs with emojis for vocabulary words in the backend. This involved updating the  file to change the  field for 23 specific words across multiple categories (e.g., Couleurs, Animaux, Nombres, Corps, Maison, Nature) to direct Unicode emojis. For example, the  for Maison was changed to üè†, for Plage to üèñÔ∏è, and for For√™t to üå≥. The  tool was used to efficiently apply these changes. This modification enhances visual consistency and reduces the need for external image assets. The AI has completed the backend update and is now in a state to test these changes on the frontend to ensure the emojis are displayed correctly.
