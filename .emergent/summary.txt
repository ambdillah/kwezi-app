The AI engineer's work on the Kwezi app involved extensive feature development and critical bug fixes, primarily focusing on preparing the application for Google Play Store deployment. The trajectory began with a thorough pre-deployment verification to confirm data integrity post-fork, ensuring the application's stability. Key tasks included fixing a spelling error for the French verb entérer to enterrer and resolving two significant issues in the construire des phrases game: inconsistent verb prefix coloring and the absence of automatic session restarts. A crucial linguistic correction for Kibouchi present tense verb conjugation was implemented, adjusting the rule to retain the m prefix in infinitives, which involved database updates and frontend rule adjustments. For Play Store registration, a dedicated landing page was created, and the app's configuration was updated for EAS builds, though automated build attempts failed. The engineer then facilitated local build by preparing code and audio archives, making them downloadable via FastAPI. The final, ongoing task is a systematic analysis to resolve pervasive audio-to-word mismatches and missing audio files, ensuring the highest quality for deployment.

The Kwezi application is an educational platform for Shimaoré and Kibouchi, focused on authentic, user-recorded audio and robust data integrity. Key features include a freemium monetization model (€2.90/month, limiting free users to 250 words), a Boutique for PDF exercise sheets, and language learning games like the Mayotte quiz and construire des phrases. Implemented functionality covers refactored Text-to-Speech, data integrity fixes, comprehensive authentic audio coverage, paginated loading, a fully functional freemium system (Premium screen, paywall, Stripe integration with webhooks for  logic, customer portal), and a word search feature. Legal documents (, , ) are established, with recent updates including a children's responsibility disclaimer and a mandatory CGU checkbox during payment. The app is nearing readiness for Google Play Store deployment, involving package name configuration, EAS build setup, and a dedicated landing page. Recent efforts focused on correcting French verb conjugation, enhancing game mechanics, and systematically resolving audio-to-word mismatches. The primary goal is a polished, native-feeling application ready for deployment.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was actively engaged in a comprehensive effort to address a critical audio quality issue. The user reported multiple specific audio problems, including missing audio for baba (Kibouchi) and nindri héli/bé, incorrect audio for viavi, and a general observation of widespread mismatches between word orthography and their corresponding audio files across the application.

To resolve this systemically, a new Python script, , was created. This script is designed to perform a thorough, word-by-word analysis of the entire database to pinpoint any instance where a word's text does not accurately correspond to its assigned audio file or where an audio file is entirely absent. The execution of this script has just been initiated, signifying a dedicated effort to ensure meticulous audio accuracy for the entire Kwezi vocabulary.

Prior to launching this broad analysis, the AI engineer had already implemented several specific word and audio corrections as requested by the user: replacing chouroungou foudjé with chouroungou voudjé, replacing ouvendza with ouna gnandzo and integrating its new audio file (), and deleting the word garçon. These targeted corrections were verified, and updated archives of the frontend code and audio assets (, ) were generated and made available via new FastAPI download routes. The current task is to build upon these specific fixes by identifying and addressing all remaining general audio inconsistencies to ensure the application's readiness for deployment.
