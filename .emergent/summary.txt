<analysis>
The AI engineer's trajectory focused on crucial pre-deployment tasks for the Kwezi app. The initial phase involved a comprehensive data integrity and audio correspondence audit, identifying 66 missing audio files. Subsequent corrections addressed spelling inconsistencies (entérer to enterrer), Kibouchi orthography (y to v, houndza), and the integration of specific new audio files like Hayitri.m4a, Moinagna.m4a, and Baba k.m4a. This reduced missing audios to 58. A critical audio playback bug, where users had to click multiple times, was traced to a missing  flag, an aggressive 10-second audio timeout, and problematic synthesis voice fallback logic in . These were systematically corrected. A large archive of 136 expressions audio files was integrated, further reducing missing audios to 16. Finally, deployment archives (frontend code and audio assets) were generated and made downloadable via FastAPI, necessitating file path corrections and server route updates. The current interaction is dedicated to guiding the user through setting up their local environment for an EAS build, troubleshooting common issues like incorrect directory navigation and missing Git, leading to the prompt to configure an existing EAS project.

<product_requirements>
The Kwezi application serves as an educational platform for Shimaoré and Kibouchi languages, emphasizing authentic, user-recorded audio and robust data integrity. It operates on a freemium model, limiting free users to 250 words and offering premium subscriptions (€2.90/month) with Stripe integration. Additional monetization comes from PDF exercise sheets sold in a Boutique. Learning games include a Mayotte quiz and construire des phrases (sentence building). Core functionalities encompass refactored Text-to-Speech, extensive authentic audio coverage, paginated content loading, a fully operational freemium system (paywall, Stripe webhooks with  logic, customer portal), and a word search feature. Legal documents (privacy policy, terms of sale, legal notices) are in place, with recent updates for a children's responsibility disclaimer and a mandatory CGU checkbox before payment. The app is being prepared for Google Play Store deployment, including package name configuration, EAS build setup, and a dedicated landing page. Recent development concentrated on refining French verb conjugations, enhancing game mechanics, and systematically resolving audio-to-word mismatches to ensure a polished, native-feeling application.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was actively guiding the user through the process of performing a local Android build using Expo Application Services (EAS). The user had downloaded the application archives and extracted them. The primary challenge being addressed was the user's difficulty in correctly navigating to the project directory and executing EAS commands.

The engineer provided step-by-step instructions to:
1.  Verify the presence of Node.js and the installation of global Expo CLI and EAS CLI tools (
added 5 packages, and changed 1757 packages in 4m

209 packages are looking for funding
  run `npm fund` for details).
2.  Log in to Expo (Log in to EAS with email or username (exit and run eas login --help to see other login options)
Input is required, but stdin is not readable. Failed to display prompt: Email or username).
3.  Navigate to the correct project directory where the extracted application files (e.g., , , , ) reside. This involved several rounds of troubleshooting as the user struggled with  and Famille_   components	   eslint.config.js   node_modules	 qr_expo.html
