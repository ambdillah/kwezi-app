The previous AI engineer's work centered on preparing the Kwezi app for deployment, initiating with comprehensive data and audio integrity checks. This involved fixing 66 missing audio files, correcting spelling inconsistencies (e.g., entérer to enterrer), Kibouchi orthography, and resolving a critical audio playback bug linked to the  flag and aggressive audio timeouts. A large batch of 136 expressions audio files was integrated, significantly reducing missing audios to 16. The engineer then generated deployable frontend code and audio archives, creating download routes via FastAPI. The primary challenge during this trajectory was guiding the user through the local EAS Android build process, encountering issues such as an overly large build archive (due to incorrect working directory and un-ignored ), persistent missing asset errors (, , ,  indicating improper project setup on the user's local machine), and finally, Node.js version incompatibility and Kotlin compilation failures related to  and , suggesting a need to align React Native versions or address new architecture configurations.

<product_requirements>
The Kwezi application is an educational platform for Shimaoré and Kibouchi languages, emphasizing authentic audio and data integrity. It operates on a freemium model (250 free words, €2.90/month premium via Stripe) and offers PDF exercise sheets. Features include refactored Text-to-Speech, extensive authentic audio, paginated content, a word search, and learning games (Mayotte quiz, sentence building). Legal documents (privacy policy, terms of sale, legal notices) are implemented with recent updates for children's responsibility and a mandatory CGU checkbox before payment. The app is being prepared for Google Play Store deployment, which includes package name configuration, EAS build setup, and a dedicated landing page. Recent development focused on refining French verb conjugations, enhancing game mechanics, and resolving audio-to-word mismatches for a polished user experience.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was deep into troubleshooting a series of EAS Android build failures for the Kwezi application. Initially, the user faced a  error (2.7 GB vs 2.0 GB limit) because they were attempting the build from their general  directory, which contained many unrelated files and a large  folder. The engineer guided the user to delete  and then, crucially, to move the project to a clean directory . This resolved the archive size issue, reducing it to 32.3 MB.

However, subsequent build attempts failed due to missing asset files referenced in  and various React Native components. Specifically, errors were reported for:
1.   (from )
2.   (from )
3.   (from )
4.   (from )

These errors indicated that while the codebase might contain these references, the actual image files were not present in the user's  directory during the build archive creation, suggesting improper extraction or placement of the  subdirectory by the user.

After these asset issues were seemingly bypassed (or the user implicitly fixed them, as the build progressed further), the build failed during the Install dependencies phase due to a Node.js version incompatibility on the EAS build server ( required Node , but  was present).

Finally, the build progressed to the Run gradlew phase but failed with Kotlin compilation errors:  and  in . This suggests a deeper issue with React Native's new architecture ( in ) setup or a mismatch between the project's React Native version ( used vs  recommended) and the EAS build environment's expectations. The previous AI engineer determined this is the next critical problem to address.
