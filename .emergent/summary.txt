The trajectory chronicles a comprehensive and intense effort to repair and reconstruct the Kwezi app's backend and database. The work began with the user's panicked report of total data loss, which the AI engineer quickly disproved by running a diagnostic script, revealing it was a false alarm. This triggered a deep-dive debugging session into the FastAPI backend. The engineer systematically resolved a cascade of issues in  and , including incorrect database names, missing API routes, and critical data model mismatches between the Pydantic schema and the MongoDB structure.

Frustrated with lingering data inaccuracies, the user demanded a complete database reconstruction from a provided PDF. The engineer executed this by writing a series of Python scripts to parse the PDF, wipe the old data, and rebuild the vocabulary collection from scratch. Following this, the user provided ZIP files with authentic audio for animaux and adjectifs, which the engineer successfully mapped and integrated.

The final phase involved addressing a user report that the app's frontend showed no data. This was traced back to the frontend calling an old, incompatible API endpoint. The engineer patched the endpoint to work with the new database schema, successfully restoring frontend functionality. The work concluded with the discovery that the PDF-based reconstruction was still incomplete, and the engineer was in the process of running a final script to import the remaining ~190 missing words.

<product_requirements>
The Kwezi app is an educational tool for learning the Shimaoré and Kibouchi languages. The primary goal is to ensure the application's data is a perfect and complete representation of the content provided by the user in a definitive PDF document.

**Core Requirements:**
1.  **Data Source of Truth:** The MongoDB  collection must be an exact mirror of the user-provided PDF, including all words, phrases, and their corresponding French, Shimaoré, and Kibouchi translations. The current target word count is approximately 696.
2.  **Authentic Audio Integration:** The system must allow for the meticulous mapping of authentic audio pronunciations, provided by the user in ZIP archives, to their respective words in the database.
3.  **API Reliability:** The FastAPI backend must have stable, functional API endpoints (, , ) that correctly serve the vocabulary data and audio files to the frontend without errors.
4.  **Frontend Functionality:** The Expo frontend application must successfully fetch and display all vocabulary sections and words, reflecting the accurate state of the backend database. The user experience should be seamless, with no apparent data loss or loading failures.

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Full-Stack Architecture:** Expo (React Native) frontend, FastAPI backend, and MongoDB database.
- **Data ETL (Extract, Transform, Load):** Extensive use of single-run Python scripts with  to perform complex database operations, including data wiping, schema correction, and complete reconstruction from a PDF source.
- **API Debugging & Repair:** Diagnosed and fixed critical backend bugs in  related to incorrect environment variables (), Pydantic data model mismatches, and incorrect database/collection/field names.
- **Asset Management:** Process for downloading, unzipping, and mapping user-provided audio files to database entries.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application uses a standard monorepo structure with separate directories for the frontend and backend.



-   ****
    -   **Importance:** This is the core FastAPI application file. It defines all API endpoints that serve data to the frontend.
    -   **Changes:** This file underwent significant modifications. The engineer restored missing routes, created a new compatible  endpoint to resolve a data model mismatch with the frontend, and ensured all database queries used the correct field names (, ) instead of legacy ones (, ).

-   ****
    -   **Importance:** Contains critical environment variables for the backend, including the database connection details.
    -   **Changes:** The  variable was corrected from  to . This was a crucial fix that resolved a major API failure where no data was being found.

-   ****
    -   **Importance:** This is the most recent script created to perform the final and complete data import from the user's PDF.
    -   **Changes:** This file was created to rectify an incomplete data extraction, with the goal of adding all ~696 words from the PDF to the database.

-   ****
    -   **Importance:** This script handles the complex task of mapping audio filenames from user-provided ZIPs to the correct Shimaoré or Kibouchi words in the database.
    -   **Changes:** It was created and executed successfully for the animaux and adjectifs sections, updating over 100 words with authentic audio links.

-   ****
    -   **Importance:** This directory stores all the authentic audio files that are served to the user.
    -   **Changes:** It was populated with audio files for the animaux and adjectifs sections by the  script.
</code_architecture>

<pending_tasks>
- **Complete Audio Mapping:** The user intends to provide more ZIP files for the remaining 14 vocabulary sections. A process will be needed to map them.
- **Fix Audio API Endpoint:** The audio serving endpoint was returning a  error. This issue was deferred and needs to be resolved so users can hear the authentic pronunciations.
- **Full User Validation:** Once the database is complete and all features are working, the user must perform a thorough review and confirm the application meets their expectations.

<current_work>
The most recent task was a critical data integrity check initiated by the user. After the AI engineer had rebuilt the database from a PDF and fixed the frontend's display issues, the user correctly pointed out that the word count was too low (507 instead of an expected 565+).

The engineer re-analyzed the source PDF and confirmed a significant number of words (~189) had been missed during the initial data extraction, primarily compound words and multi-word expressions.

In response, the engineer performed a more thorough data extraction from the PDF. The immediate last action was creating a new, comprehensive script, , designed to add all the newly identified missing words to the  collection in MongoDB. The trajectory ends precisely at the point where this final import script is ready to be executed to bring the database to 100% completion according to the PDF source of truth.
