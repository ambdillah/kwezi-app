The trajectory chronicles an extensive series of updates to the Kwezi language learning app, moving from bug-fixing and data enrichment to implementing new features. The initial task was to change the Text-to-Speech (TTS) voice to female, which involved refactoring all  calls across the frontend. This led to debugging a significant preview issue caused by a JavaScript syntax error () and Metro bundler caching problems.

A major portion of the work involved intensive data integrity operations. The AI engineer processed numerous user-provided images and ZIP archives to correct translations, update quiz answers in the Découverte de Mayotte game, and, most critically, restore and ensure 100% authentic audio pronunciation coverage for multiple vocabulary sections (expressions, traditions, nature, vêtements, salutations). This was accomplished using a series of purpose-built Python scripts for data extraction, mapping, and database updates via .

Following data corrections, the focus shifted to UX improvements, specifically optimizing the slow loading of the Commencer à apprendre screen by implementing paginated loading by category and adding an animated loading indicator.

The final and most substantial initiative was beginning the implementation of a freemium monetization model. The engineer successfully built the entire backend foundation for this, including user creation, premium status tracking, and API endpoints that limit content for free users (250 words). The frontend work began with setting up a global  to manage user state. The trajectory concludes with the user interrupting the monetization work to ask for a summary of the implemented French conjugation rules, indicating a bug in the Construire des phrases game.

<product_requirements>
The Kwezi application is an educational tool for learning the Shimaoré and Kibouchi languages, with a core focus on authenticity and user engagement.

**Core Requirements:**
1.  **Audio Authenticity:** Every word and expression must feature an authentic, user-provided audio file. Synthetic TTS is only a fallback. The goal is to maintain 100% authentic audio coverage across all vocabulary.
2.  **Data Integrity:** All vocabulary, expressions, and quiz questions must be accurate and grammatically correct, reflecting the user's corrections.
3.  **User Experience:** The application must be performant and intuitive. This includes fast load times (addressed in the  screen) and smooth, engaging game mechanics.
4.  **Monetization (Freemium Model):** The app will be monetized through a premium subscription.
    *   **Free Tier:** Users can access a limited set of 250 words.
    *   **Premium Tier:** A monthly subscription (€2.90/month) unlocks all content (~569+ words) and future exclusive features.
    *   **Implementation:** The initial development uses a simulated payment system, with plans to integrate Stripe for production. The app must clearly distinguish between free and premium content and provide an attractive upgrade path.
</product_requirements>

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Full-Stack Architecture:** Monorepo with a FastAPI (Python) backend, MongoDB database, and an Expo (React Native) frontend.
- **Data ETL:** Extensive use of temporary Python scripts using  to parse user-provided data (from images and ZIPs), clean it, and perform bulk updates to the MongoDB database to ensure data and audio authenticity.
- **Backend API Development:** Addition of a complete user management and monetization system in , with endpoints for user creation, status checks, and premium upgrades. API logic was modified to serve limited content to free users.
- **Frontend State Management:** Introduction of the React Context API () and  to manage global user state, including user ID and premium status, across the application.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application uses a monorepo structure with separate  and  directories.



-   ****
    -   **Importance:** The core FastAPI application serving all data to the frontend.
    -   **Summary of Changes:** This file was heavily modified to implement the freemium model. New Pydantic models (, ) and a new MongoDB collection () were added. Key endpoints were created:  (create/get user),  (set user to premium), and  (fetches words, limiting to 250 for free users). It was the target of numerous data updates performed by external scripts.

-   ****
    -   **Importance:** The main vocabulary learning screen.
    -   **Summary of Changes:** This screen was refactored to address performance issues. Instead of fetching all 566+ words on load, it now fetches words for one category by default. A Voir tout (See All) button was added to load the complete list on demand. A new animated loading component was created and implemented to improve the user experience during data fetching.

-   ****
    -   **Importance:** A new file that establishes a global state for the current user.
    -   **Summary of Changes:** Created from scratch, this file uses React's Context API to provide user data (user ID, premium status) to any component in the app. It handles fetching user data from the backend, creating a new user if one doesn't exist, and persisting the user ID using .

-   ****
    -   **Importance:** The root layout of the Expo Router application.
    -   **Summary of Changes:** This file was modified to wrap the entire application with the  from , making the global user state accessible everywhere.

-   ****
    -   **Importance:** Contains the logic for multiple in-app games.
    -   **Summary of Changes:** All  calls were replaced with a centralized function to use a female TTS voice. A critical bug was fixed by adding the  keyword to the  function.

-   ****
    -   **Importance:** A static data file containing the questions and answers for the Découverte de Mayotte game.
    -   **Summary of Changes:** The file was edited multiple times to apply user-provided corrections to quiz answers, ensuring the game's factual accuracy.

<pending_tasks>
- **Implement Frontend Monetization UI:**
    - Integrate the  into  to conditionally display a paywall/upgrade message.
    - Build the Boutique (Shop) page UI.
    - Implement the simulated payment flow to upgrade a user's status.
    - Add visual indicators (e.g., Premium badge) for premium users.
- **Fix Conjugation Error:** Investigate and fix the conjugation error in the Construire des phrases game reported by the user.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the development of the premium feature was paused due to a user-reported issue. The user noted an error in the Construire des phrases game and asked for a reminder of the conjugation rules that had been implemented.

The AI engineer's last actions were focused on fulfilling this request. The work involved:
1.  **Code Investigation:** Searching the codebase to locate where and how sentence conjugation logic is handled.
2.  **Identifying the Source:** The investigation revealed that conjugation rules were not applied dynamically in the frontend. Instead, a one-time Python script, , was previously run to correct verb conjugations directly in the MongoDB database. This script contains dictionaries mapping verbs to their correct forms (e.g., ).
3.  **Preparing the Summary:** The engineer was in the process of creating a summary document () based on the logic found in that Python script to present to the user. The work concluded just after successfully creating this markdown file, before presenting the summary.

<optional_next_step>
Present the summary of the conjugation rules from the  file. Then, ask the user to describe the specific error they encountered in the Construire des phrases game so I can investigate and fix it.
