The AI engineer's work primarily focused on expanding and correcting the Kwezi app's vocabulary and audio pronunciations across multiple language sections. Initially, the process involved updating animaux and nombres sections using user-provided images, creating new backend scripts for data extraction and database insertion. A significant effort was made to integrate new audio pronunciations for corps humain, nombres, animaux, and salutations sections, requiring the creation of missing database sections.

Subsequently, the nourriture and maison sections were introduced and populated with orthographically corrected data from images, followed by audio integration. The vêtement and nature sections underwent similar creation and update processes, including both text and audio. User concerns about verb pronunciations led to a comprehensive database verification, creating verbes and transport sections. A full database reconstruction from a PDF was executed to establish an authentic vocabulary baseline. The work culminated in repeated attempts to fix verb audio correspondences, addressing user-reported mismatches by diagnosing missing audio files and preparing a final mapping script. The current task is to execute this last mapping.

The Kwezi app is an educational mobile application designed for children to learn Shimaoré and Kibouchi through engaging games and authentic audio. The previous development cycle addressed:
1.  **Construire des phrases Game Refinement:** Fixed abimer verb bug, implemented conjugation coloring (Orange for past, Green for future) for verbs, corrected wassi to wasi, and restored the feminine text-to-speech voice.
2.  **Vocabulary & Audio Updates (Initial):** Updated famille vocabulary with new words, text corrections, and integrating new audio from a ZIP file.
3.  **Découverte de Mayotte Game:** Prototype developed using a simplified SVG map, after MapLibre GL integration failed due to Expo Go incompatibility.
The current focus in the trajectory has been on expanding the app's content by adding and updating multiple vocabulary sections (Animaux, Nombres, Corps Humain, Salutations, Nourriture, Maison, Vêtement, Nature, Adjectifs, Verbes, Transport) with correct orthography and authentic audio pronunciations, often requiring section creation where they didn't exist, and resolving persistent audio-to-word mapping inconsistencies, especially for verbs.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was engaged in a critical task to resolve persistent pronunciation errors for verbs. The user explicitly highlighted issues like oumengna having the same pronunciation as mandroubaka, indicating severe audio-to-word mapping inconsistencies.

The AI engineer performed the following actions:
1.  **Analyzed Existing Correspondences**: Inspected the current verb entries in the database to confirm the mismatches.
2.  **Listed Available Audio Files**: Examined the  directory to identify all actual audio files.
3.  **Diagnosed the Root Cause**: Discovered that the expected audio file Oumengna.m4a was entirely missing, while Mandroubaka.m4a existed. This clarified why the previous attempts at mapping were failing; the system was trying to map to a non-existent file.
4.  **Created a Targeted Fix Script**: A new Python script, , was created. This script is designed to establish correct audio mappings for verbs by directly referencing the *actually available* audio files, thereby resolving the oumengna / mandroubaka confusion and other similar mismatches.

The AI is currently at the stage of executing this newly created script to apply the corrected verb audio mappings.
