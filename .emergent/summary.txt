<analysis>
The AI engineer successfully initiated an Expo mobile application for learning Shimaoré and Kibouchi. It established a full-stack architecture using Expo/React Native for the frontend and FastAPI/MongoDB for the backend. Initial development focused on creating core learning modules, games, progress tracking, and an admin interface, all styled with a unique Mayotte-specific design. The application was incrementally enhanced with features like a badge system, offline mode, and user data export. A significant portion of the work involved meticulous vocabulary management: initial population, multiple rounds of expansion based on user-provided tables (for basic words, numbers, family, grammar, colors, and animals), and extensive corrections to both Shimaoré/Kibouchi translations and French orthography. The AI frequently used backend testing and, when allowed, frontend mobile testing to validate changes. Towards the end, the AI faced challenges with duplicate removal in the animal vocabulary, requiring multiple attempts and manual inspection, indicating a need for more robust data handling or a clearer duplicate resolution strategy. The last action was an update to verbs based on new tables, followed by a backend test and expo restart, showing a continuous effort to refine the application's content.

<product_requirements>
The user requested an educational mobile application for children to learn Shimaoré and Kibouchi, indigenous languages of Mayotte. The app should feature engaging games and illustrations, audio/pronunciation for words, and an admin panel for content management including uploading illustrations (PNG preferred), text, audio, and exercises. The design must be easy-to-use, original, and culturally specific to Mayotte (yellow/black, ylang-ylang, makis motifs), drawing inspiration from existing children's learning apps. Post-initial build, additional features requested included native Shimaoré/Kibouchi audio, offline mode, a badge/reward system, and user data export. The user actively provided extensive vocabulary tables and numerous specific corrections for translations and French orthography across categories like greetings, colors, animals, numbers, family, grammar, and verbs, indicating a strong desire for linguistic accuracy and comprehensive content.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was focused on extensively updating and refining the  vocabulary in the backend. The user provided two image-based tables for verbs and explicitly asked for precise replication of the content and correction of French spelling mistakes. The AI successfully implemented these changes in , correcting French orthography (e.g., Faire caca to Faire ses besoins) and adding new verbs related to domestic activities, crafts, and agriculture, expanding the verb count from 75 to 95, bringing the total word count in the application to 271. The last action was an  operation in . The AI stated it would next test the backend for these verb updates and restart the Expo service.
