The AI engineer's work in this trajectory predominantly focused on comprehensive database management and iterative content updates for the Shimaoré and Kibouchi learning application. Initially, UI fixes for game start screens and a backend shift from image URLs to emojis were made. The core challenge became resolving persistent data loss and inconsistency: the database was found empty, then user-provided authentic translations were lost due to improper re-initialization logic. The engineer systematically extracted data from user-provided PDFs and images, creating and executing numerous Python scripts to rebuild and update specific vocabulary sections (nature, chiffres, animaux, corps, salutations, grammaire, famille, couleurs, nourriture, maison, verbes, expressions, adjectifs, transport, vêtements, tradition). Each update involved meticulous verification of word counts, translations, deduplication, and alphabetical sorting, often requiring multiple iterations due to subtle discrepancies or category mismatches. Frontend display issues, like incorrect emoji rendering and env URL configuration, were also addressed. The work culminated in applying final user-requested corrections.

<product_requirements>
The user requires an educational mobile application for children to learn Shimaoré and Kibouchi, featuring engaging games, illustrations, audio pronunciation, an admin panel, offline mode, badge system, and user data export. The primary ongoing need is the continuous refinement of vocabulary, including adding words, correcting translations, rectifying French orthography, and managing categories. Earlier work included implementing alphabetical/numerical sorting and developing three interactive games.

In this trajectory, explicit requests involved:
1.  **UI Fix for Quiz Mayotte & Mémoire des fleurs**: Optimize start screen layouts for proper display on mobile.
2.  **Content Visualization Change**: Replace image URLs with small, pretty symbols (emojis) for vocabulary items in the backend.
3.  **Database Restoration**: Recover and restore a lost portion of authentic, user-entered vocabulary and translations.
4.  **Database Updates**: Update the entire vocabulary database based on a provided PDF, then sequentially update specific sections (nature, chiffres, animaux, corps humain, salutations, grammaire, famille, couleurs, nourriture, maison, verbes, expressions, adjectifs, transport, vêtements, tradition) using various user-provided images, ensuring exact word counts, correct translations, deduplication, and alphabetical sorting.
5.  **Final Corrections**: Apply a list of specific word and expression corrections from a user-provided table.

<code_architecture>
The application follows a standard Expo full-stack architecture:



-   :
    -   **Importance**: Handles all data and API logic, serving vocabulary content.
    -   **Changes Made**: Initial update to  values from external URLs to Unicode emojis for 23 specific words. The  endpoint was an issue, leading to its effective bypass by subsequent dynamic scripts. Contains FastAPI endpoints for CRUD operations and database initialization.
-   :
    -   **Importance**: Contains UI logic for learning games (Quiz Mayotte, Mémoire des fleurs).
    -   **Changes Made**: Styles (, , etc.) were added/modified to optimize start screens for mobile, addressing layout and button positioning issues.
-   :
    -   **Importance**: Displays vocabulary content, particularly where emojis are rendered.
    -   **Changes Made**: Modified to correctly render emojis as text rather than attempting to load them as image URLs. Specific styles (, ) were added for this purpose.
-   :
    -   **Importance**: Holds environment variables for Expo, including backend API URL.
    -   **Changes Made**:  was corrected to point to the local backend to resolve frontend loading issues.
-    (e.g., , , , etc.):
    -   **Importance**: Dynamically generated scripts for one-time database operations.
    -   **Changes Made**: Numerous scripts were created to:
        -   Restore an initial authentic dataset.
        -   Rebuild the database from a user-provided PDF.
        -   Incrementally update specific vocabulary categories (nature, chiffres, animaux, corps, salutations, grammaire, famille, couleurs, nourriture, maison, verbes, expressions, adjectifs, transport, vêtements, tradition) by extracting data from images. These scripts included logic for deduplication and alphabetical sorting within categories and explicitly deleted old content before adding new.
-   :
    -   **Importance**: A script created to apply a final set of specific corrections to words and expressions in the database as requested by the user.
    -   **Changes Made**: This script contained  operations for a list of 34 specific words, updating their , , and  fields based on user input.

<pending_tasks>
-   Implement frontend UI for audio playback to enable children to listen to word pronunciations.
-   Develop and integrate a personal word mastery system (e.g., clickable stars/colors).
-   Implement full support for multiple audio pronunciations per word (e.g., Shimaoré and Kibouchi for Papa).
-   Extend image/icon coverage to a broader range of vocabulary words across all categories (now with emojis).
-   Conduct comprehensive frontend mobile UI testing on Expo Go for all implemented features and content updates.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was in the process of applying final corrections to the vocabulary database based on a user-provided table of words and expressions. A new script, , was created and executed to programmatically update 34 specific entries in the MongoDB database, ensuring the , , and  translations matched the user's explicit corrections. After executing the script, the AI attempted to manually verify some of these corrections via direct API calls, but these calls returned too much data for quick manual inspection. Therefore, the engineer decided the next logical step was to use the backend testing agent for a more efficient and comprehensive verification of these applied corrections.
