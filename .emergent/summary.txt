The previous AI engineer's work primarily focused on resolving critical EAS Android build failures for the Kwezi application, following initial data integrity checks. Key challenges included correcting dependency mismatches between React Native and Expo SDK, disabling new architecture features (), addressing persistent missing asset errors (, , , ), and resolving various peer dependency issues (, , ). Multiple attempts to build locally failed due to environment-specific issues on the user's Windows machine, particularly Node.js TypeScript stripping problems. Eventually, the strategy shifted to building the application from the more stable Emergent environment, which successfully produced an Android APK. The trajectory concludes with the user reporting that the built app lacks data and is incompatible with their Expo Go version, indicating a new set of issues related to backend connectivity and local testing setup.

<product_requirements>
The Kwezi application is an educational platform for learning Shimaoré and Kibouchi languages, emphasizing authentic audio and data integrity. It features a freemium model (250 free words, €2.90/month premium via Stripe) and offers PDF exercise sheets. Core functionalities include refined Text-to-Speech, extensive authentic audio content, paginated content, a word search feature, and learning games (Mayotte quiz, sentence building). Legal documents (privacy policy, terms of sale, legal notices) are integrated, updated with children's responsibility clauses and a mandatory CGU checkbox before payment. The app is being prepared for Google Play Store deployment, necessitating proper package name configuration, EAS build setup, and a dedicated landing page. Recent development efforts focused on refining French verb conjugations, enhancing game mechanics, and resolving audio-to-word mismatches to provide a polished user experience.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer successfully guided the user through a complex EAS Android build process for the Kwezi application. After numerous attempts and troubleshooting steps on the user's local Windows machine (including correcting dependency versions,  flags, Node.js environment variables, and missing asset files), the strategy shifted to performing the build directly within the Emergent environment using the provided EAS access token. This resulted in a successful Android APK build, which was made available for download.

However, the user reported a critical issue: the newly built application, when run (presumably in the Emergent web preview as Expo Go was incompatible), showed no words from the database. The AI engineer promptly checked the MongoDB database, confirming that 635 words were present in the  collection. The current task is to diagnose why the deployed application is not connecting to or fetching data from the correct backend database. The conversation ended with the user confirming they are testing on the Emergent web preview and that their Expo Go app (v54) is incompatible with the SDK 52 version of the application.
