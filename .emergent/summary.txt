The AI engineer's work has primarily focused on resolving persistent Android APK build failures for the Kwezi application, crucial for its Google Play Store deployment and offline premium features. Initial attempts involved several Expo SDK downgrades (from 54 to 50), Node.js version alignment, and backend URL corrections for a Render.com deployment. Despite numerous fixes, EAS builds continuously failed due to various issues like Expo login, Kotlin compilation errors, and underlying dependency conflicts. The strategy then shifted to GitHub Actions for more control, but this also faced hurdles with GitHub authentication (PATs), secret scanning, and workflow syntax errors. The  was repeatedly engaged, identifying issues like deprecated GitHub Actions versions, incorrect The following error occurred:

See more help with --help syntax,  crashes, and problematic  fallbacks in the frontend. The current critical challenge revolves around a persistent dependency mismatch ( vs ) and ensuring environment variables are correctly consumed by EAS Build. The AI is now guiding the user through granular GitHub modifications.

<product_requirements>
The Kwezi application is an educational platform for learning ShimaorÃ© and Kibouchi, targeting Google Play Store deployment. It implements a freemium model offering 250 free words, with a premium subscription unlocking full access and PDF exercise sheets, crucially including *offline mode* functionality. Core features include refined Text-to-Speech, extensive authentic audio content, paginated learning content, a word search, and interactive learning games. Legal documents are integrated. The primary, critical goal is to produce a stable, functional Android APK that correctly connects to the Render.com backend and displays all data, supporting the offline premium features. Despite numerous efforts, the application is not yet fully functional as an APK, showing issues like being empty (no data), crashing, or failing to build, leading to user frustration and an explicit demand for a complete, perfect, and functional application, rejecting PWA as an alternative.
