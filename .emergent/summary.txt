The AI engineer's work has primarily focused on robustifying the application's backend database, enhancing content accuracy, and improving frontend user experience. Initial efforts fixed a critical Construire des phrases game bug where it was stuck loading, by addressing an empty  endpoint and initializing sentences. A major challenge involved recurring database corruption and duplication, which led to the implementation of a multi-layered database protection system, including automatic backups, integrity checks, and emergency restoration scripts. Numerous data corrections, including specific word translations, cultural expressions, and alphabetical sorting, were applied through custom Python scripts. Frontend enhancements included replacing generic emojis with authentic Mayotte imagery (ylang-ylang flower, maki) and implementing phonetic corrections for Shimaoré and Kibouchi TTS. The most recent ongoing task is resolving a bug where the male voice selection for text-to-speech is not being applied, and clarifying a user-provided future date for a fork.

The user requires an educational mobile application for children to learn Shimaoré and Kibouchi, featuring engaging games, illustrations, audio pronunciation, an admin panel, offline mode, badge system, and user data export. The core problem has been continuous refinement of vocabulary, ensuring accurate translations, correct orthography, and proper category management.

Explicit requests throughout the trajectory included: UI/UX optimization for games and content visualization using authentic images (ylang-ylang, maki) instead of emojis. A critical focus has been on database integrity, maintaining a 548-word authentic database, eliminating duplicates, and implementing a robust protection system. A new Construire des phrases game was implemented, requiring accurate French conjugation and sentence generation. An audio pronunciation system (Voix Off) was integrated, prioritizing authentic audio recordings and applying phonetic corrections for Shimaoré and Kibouchi TTS. Other tasks included ensuring the badge and progress system is operational, sorting database content alphabetically (with exceptions for numbers and grammar), removing emojis from sensitive words, and enabling a charismatic male voice for pronunciations.

<code_architecture>
The application follows a standard Expo full-stack architecture:



-   : Core FastAPI backend. Modified to include  endpoint, implement  decorators, add admin endpoints (, , ), and fix  serialization for progress/badges. Destructive code in  was commented out.
-   : Backend environment variables.  updated to .
-   : **NEW**. Implements a multi-layered system for database integrity, auto-backups, and emergency restoration. Updated to recognize maèva as an authentic signature.
-    (e.g., , , , etc.): **NEW**. Various scripts for applying specific data corrections, translations, and orthographic fixes to the MongoDB database based on user requests and provided data. These include updates for non, oncle paternel, au revoir, practical expressions, ancien, verbs from tables, and comprehensive cleanup.
-   : **NEW**. Script to handle alphabetical sorting, emoji removal, and general data hygiene.
-   : **NEW**. Corrected script to properly update MongoDB documents for alphabetical/logical sorting across categories.
-   : **NEW**. Script to change compound emojis for numbers 11-20 to plain text for better display.
-    & : **NEW**. Scripts for comprehensive duplicate detection, user-guided duplicate removal, and removal of emojis from sensitive words.
-   : UI and logic for games. Modified for Construire des phrases game, and integrated  and  components.
-   : Vocabulary display. Integrated  and .
-   : Home screen. Integrated  and  components.
-   : User progress. Integrated  component.
-   : Text-to-speech utility. Integrated .
-   : **NEW**. Provides specific phonetic rules for Shimaoré and Kibouchi TTS.
-    & : **NEW**. Attempts at improving speech utility and forcing a masculine voice.
-    & : **NEW**. Reusable components for authentic Mayotte illustrations, replacing generic emojis.

<pending_tasks>
- Implement frontend UI for audio playback in games other than Commencer à apprendre.
- Develop and integrate a personal word mastery system (e.g., clickable stars/colors).
- Extend the variety of French sentences in the Construire des phrases game.
- Conduct comprehensive frontend mobile UI testing on Expo Go for all implemented features.
- Investigate and resolve remaining incorrect emoji associations (e.g., curcuma with leaves, ginger with roots).
- Identify the root cause of the recurring database duplication problem (2316 words).
- Resolve the issue of the text-to-speech voice remaining female despite attempts to force a male voice.
- Clarify the user's mentioned fork date (October 19, 2025).

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was addressing a critical bug where the pronunciation of words and expressions in the application was consistently using a female voice, despite efforts to implement a male, more charismatic voice. The previous attempt involved creating and integrating  into  to explicitly select a male voice from available system voices. The user explicitly reported that the voice is still female, indicating that the fix was not successful. The AI engineer is in the process of diagnosing why the male voice selection is not being correctly applied, potentially examining limitations of  or the voice selection logic. Additionally, the user asked for clarification on a fork date (October 19, 2025), which the AI engineer noted as being in the future relative to the current session (September 18, 2025), and is awaiting user input for this clarification.
