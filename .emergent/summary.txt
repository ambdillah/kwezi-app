The AI engineer's work has primarily focused on data integrity and audio integration. Initial efforts involved correcting the nombres section, which inadvertently exposed a critical database duplication issue. This was resolved by restoring a clean backup and carefully re-adding the numbers, ensuring data consistency. Subsequently, the famille section was updated with new translations. The major part of the trajectory focused on integrating authentic audio pronunciations. This involved extracting audio files from Google Drive, mapping them to database entries, and battling persistent technical challenges in the frontend's audio playback system (e.g.,  limitations with dynamic  files in React Native, and  access issues on mobile). The solution evolved from a direct file approach to an external HTTP audio server, and finally, integrating audio serving directly into the main FastAPI backend. Orthography corruptions were also identified and fixed. The most recent task involved addressing a fundamental architectural flaw: a single audio field per word preventing dual-language authentic pronunciations. The AI is currently restructuring the database to support separate Shimaoré and Kibouchi audio fields.

<product_requirements>
The user requires an educational mobile application for children to learn Shimaoré and Kibouchi, featuring engaging games, illustrations, audio pronunciation, an admin panel, offline mode, badge system, and user data export. The core problem has been continuous refinement of vocabulary, ensuring accurate translations, correct orthography, and proper category management. The implemented features include UI/UX optimization with authentic Mayotte images (ylang-ylang, maki) and robust database integrity with a 548-word authentic database, duplicate elimination, and a protection system. A Construire des phrases game, an audio pronunciation system (Voix Off) with phonetic corrections, and an operational badge/progress system are also in place. Database content is sorted alphabetically (with exceptions), emojis are removed from sensitive words, and attempts have been made to enable a charismatic male voice for pronunciations.

<code_architecture>
The application follows a standard Expo full-stack architecture:



-   : Core FastAPI backend.
    -   **Changes:**
        -   Modified to include new audio fields (, , , , ) in the  Pydantic model for serializing audio metadata.
        -   Integrated audio file serving endpoints (, , ) directly into the main FastAPI application to circumvent  access issues on mobile.
-   : Implements database integrity.
    -   **Changes:** Corrected class name from  to  and method calls like  to .
-    (New): Script to add/update number translations from user-provided images.
    -   **Changes:** Numerous corrections made during its development including class names, method calls, collection names ( to ), and field names ( to ).
-    (New): Script to restore the database from a specified backup.
    -   **Changes:** Fixed a  during initial execution.
-    (New): Script to add/update family translations from user-provided images.
-    (New): Script to integrate audio file metadata for the famille section into the MongoDB database.
-   , ,  (New): Scripts to attempt automated downloading of audio files from Google Drive. These encountered access restrictions.

-    (New): Script to extract audio files from a user-uploaded ZIP into .
-    (New): Script to add any missing audio metadata for famille words.
-    (New): Script to map and integrate audio file metadata for the nature section into the MongoDB database.
-    (New): Temporary script to test the backend audio system.
-    (New): A temporary FastAPI server to serve audio files on port 8002. This approach was later abandoned in favor of integrating endpoints into .
-    (New): Script to correct specific orthography errors (e.g., bwéni for madame).
-    (New): Script to generate a report of word-to-audio file mappings.
-    (New): Script for an in-depth report on translation-to-pronunciation mappings, highlighting mismatches.
-    (New): Script to correct specific audio mappings (e.g., famille and frère).
-    (New): Script to handle the special case of frère requiring different audio files for Shimaoré and Kibouchi.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was addressing a fundamental architectural flaw in the audio pronunciation system. The user identified that the current system, having a single audio field per word, prevented the correct association of authentic pronunciations for both Shimaoré and Kibouchi when both were available. This resulted in one language often defaulting to non-original text-to-speech.

The user explicitly requested to: crée des tableaux avec une colonne en français, une colonne de traduction en shimaoré, une colonne en kibouchi, une colonne de prononciation des mots en kibouchi et une colonne de prononciation en shimaoré. de cette manière tu associe chaque mot ou expression en français à sa traduction dans les deux langues avec les prononciations qui vont avec.

The AI engineer acknowledged this as a critical problem and decided to restructure the database to support separate audio fields for each language. A new script, , was created, and its execution was initiated to perform this database schema change.
