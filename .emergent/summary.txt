The AI engineer's trajectory involved significantly enhancing the Kwezi app's dual-language audio system and addressing critical bugs. Initially, the Construire des phrases game bug, where only abimer verbs appeared, was resolved by modifying the  endpoint in  to shuffle results and increase the default limit. Following this, extensive audio integration was performed for multiple categories. This encompassed downloading, extracting, and mapping audio files to database entries using custom Python scripts. The  was updated with new endpoints and category auto-detection. A critical  vs  typo in database field names was identified and corrected. The AI engineer also successfully diagnosed and provided solutions for an Expo Go preview issue, including generating QR codes. Over 11 new vocabulary categories were integrated incrementally, leading to a total of 16 supported categories with 790+ authentic audio files. Each integration involved rigorous backend testing. The current task is to meticulously analyze a provided PDF for orthographic and pronunciation errors, as well as duplicates, to further refine data integrity.

The user requires an educational mobile application for children to learn Shimaoré and Kibouchi. The app emphasizes engaging games, illustrations, and authentic audio pronunciation. Key problem areas have been refining vocabulary, ensuring accurate translations, correct orthography, and proper category management. Implemented features include UI/UX optimization with Mayotte images, a robust database (initially 548 words), duplicate elimination, and a protection system. A Construire des phrases game and an authentic audio pronunciation system (Voix Off) are in place.

Specific recent requests included:
1.  **Dual-Language Audio Restructure:** Database was explicitly restructured to support separate Shimaoré and Kibouchi audio pronunciations per word/expression.
2.  **Initial Audio Integration:** Updating pronunciations for nature, nombres, and animaux sections.
3.  **Audio Correspondence Verification:** Resolving reported mix-ups in audio correspondences.
4.  **Construire des phrases Game Fix:** Addressing the game's lack of variety, specifically propositions only for abimer.
5.  **Extensive Audio Integration:** Updating pronunciations for corps humain, salutations, couleurs, grammaire, nourriture (with a subsequent re-upload for improved coverage), verbes, expressions, adjectifs, vêtements, maison, traditions, and transports using provided audio files.
6.  **Expo Go Preview Issue:** Resolving the inability to preview the app on Expo Go.
7.  **Current Request:** Analyzing a PDF for orthographic and pronunciation errors, and eliminating duplicates.

<key_technical_concepts>
- Full-stack Development: Expo (React Native), FastAPI, MongoDB.
- Expo Router: File-based routing.
- Database Management: Python scripts for schema restructuring, data updates (adding dual audio fields), and custom data processing.
- Audio Playback:  with custom authentic audio systems served via FastAPI.
- API Interaction: Frontend-backend communication using  endpoints for data and audio.
- File Handling: Downloading and extracting ZIP files for audio assets.
- Data Validation: Custom Python scripts for verifying and correcting audio-to-word mappings, orthography, and consistency.

<code_architecture>
The application follows a standard Expo full-stack architecture.

-   : The FastAPI backend.
    -   **Importance:** Handles all API requests, including database operations and serving audio files.
    -   **Changes:** The  endpoint was modified to include  and increased its  to 20 to diversify sentence propositions. Numerous new  endpoints were added (e.g., , , etc.) for each newly integrated audio category. The  function was updated to support these new categories in its auto-detection logic and . A critical typo from shimoare to shimaore was fixed in field references for consistency.
-   : Contains logic for verb conjugation and sentence generation.
    -   **Importance:** Provides the foundational data and logic for the Construire des phrases game.
    -   **Changes:** Was inspected to understand sentence generation, but no direct modifications were made to this file in the provided trajectory, as the solution for variety was implemented in .
-    (multiple files): A series of new Python scripts (e.g., , , , , , , ).
    -   **Importance:** These scripts are crucial for automating the integration of new audio assets. They download ZIP files, extract  files into  subdirectories, and update corresponding words/expressions in the MongoDB database with , , , and  fields.
    -   **Changes:** Each script was specifically created and executed to process its designated categories. Notably,  was revised to fix the  vs  field name inconsistency.
-   : This directory now includes new subdirectories like , , , , , , , , , , , , each containing the respective  audio files.
    -   **Importance:** Central repository for all authentic dual-language audio files, organized by category.
-   , , : New files.
    -   **Importance:** Created to facilitate access to the Expo Go preview of the application by providing a scannable QR code and a web page to display it.  was updated to include  and  dependencies for this functionality.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer received a user request to analyze a PDF document titled vocabulaire shimaoré kibouchi FR.pdf. The user specifically asked to verify the orthography and integration of all Shimaoré and Kibouchi words and expressions, check their pronunciations (noting potential identical pronunciations in both languages), and eliminate any identified errors, such as duplicates (e.g., keeping bigorneau over bigorno).

The AI engineer has successfully downloaded the PDF and extracted its content. The current work involves the systematic analysis of this extracted data to identify and categorize these orthographic, pronunciation, and duplication issues. The next immediate step is to formulate and implement a correction script based on this analysis to ensure data integrity and consistency across the entire vocabulary. This task is a critical step in refining the application's foundational data.
