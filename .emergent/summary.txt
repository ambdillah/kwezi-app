The AI engineer's work on the Kwezi app involved extensive feature development and critical bug fixes. Initially, a thorough post-fork verification confirmed system stability, database integrity, and significant content additions, while identifying minor discrepancies. Subsequent tasks included creating legal documents and implementing a freemium model with Stripe integration. Crucially, the engineer corrected a major error in pronoun updates, restoring original translations. Audio system issues were frequently addressed, including fixing misconfigured dual audio fields for expressions and ensuring  functionality correctly awaited audio completion. The construire des phrases game was enhanced for language variety and correct conjugation. The engineer also addressed payment system reliability, implementing  logic in Stripe webhooks to handle new user registrations, and refined the premium screen's CGU checkbox. The current work focuses on fixing a French verb conjugation error in the sentence-building game.

<product_requirements>
The Kwezi application is an educational platform for Shimaoré and Kibouchi, prioritizing authentic, user-recorded audio and robust data integrity. Key features include a freemium monetization model (€2.90/month for full content access, limiting free users to 250 words), a Boutique for PDF exercise sheets, and language learning games. So far, the implementation has included a refactored TTS for consistency, data integrity fixes, authentic audio coverage, paginated loading, a functional freemium backend and frontend (Premium screen, paywall, Stripe integration with webhooks, customer portal), comprehensive vocabulary verification, and a word search feature. Legal documents (, , ) are also in place, with recent updates to include disclaimers for children and a mandatory CGU checkbox during payment. The app is nearing readiness for deployment.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was actively addressing a reported bug in the construire des phrases game. The user noticed that certain verbs, like amener/apporter, were not correctly conjugated in French, remaining in the infinitive form. The AI engineer diagnosed the issue, identifying 17 specific sentences in the database ( collection) where this error occurred in the  field. To rectify this, a new Python script, , was created. This script is designed to be highly targeted, correcting only the  field of these specific sentences, ensuring that the Shimaoré and Kibouchi translations, as well as other data, remain unaffected. The script has just been executed, and the next step is to verify its successful application and the correct conjugation within the game. This fix is crucial for maintaining the grammatical accuracy and quality of the language learning experience, especially given the user's emphasis on meticulous implementation.
