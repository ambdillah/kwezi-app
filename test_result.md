# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

    message: "🎵 NOUVEAU SYSTÈME AUDIO DUAL RESTRUCTURÉ TESTING COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY! All requirements from the French review request have been systematically tested and verified with perfect results. ✅ **CRITICAL SUCCESS**: The new dual audio system for the family section is fully functional and meets all specifications: 1) **DATABASE RESTRUCTURÉE**: All 25 family words have the new dual audio fields (dual_audio_system, shimoare_has_audio, kibouchi_has_audio, shimoare_audio_filename, kibouchi_audio_filename) with 25/25 words having dual system enabled, 2) **NOUVEAUX ENDPOINTS WORKING**: GET /api/words/{word_id}/audio-info returns complete dual audio information, GET /api/words/{word_id}/audio/shimaore and GET /api/words/{word_id}/audio/kibouchi serve language-specific audio files correctly, 3) **LEGACY COMPATIBILITY MAINTAINED**: Old endpoints still functional for backward compatibility, 4) **SPECIFIC TESTS PASSED**: Papa has correct Baba s.m4a (shimaoré) and Baba k.m4a (kibouchi), Famille has correct Mdjamaza.m4a (shimaoré) and Havagna.m4a (kibouchi), Frère has proper audio files for both languages, 5) **DUAL PRONUNCIATION VALIDATION**: System successfully enables TWO distinct authentic pronunciations per word (25 words with both shimaoré and kibouchi audio). The new dual audio system represents a major advancement, allowing each family word to have authentic pronunciations in BOTH languages instead of just one as before. All 6/6 comprehensive tests passed with 561 words accessible through the API. This implementation fully satisfies the French review request requirements for the restructured dual audio system."

    message: "🎯 EXPRESSIONS AND ADJECTIFS TESTING COMPLETED - CRITICAL ISSUES FOUND! The testing revealed that the current backend implementation does NOT match the user's provided images for expressions and adjectifs sections. Key findings: 1) Expression count: 35 (need 44), 2) Adjectifs count: 19 (need 52), 3) Total words: 463 (need 510), 4) Alphabetical order incorrect for both sections, 5) Missing specific required translations, 6) Missing required alphabetical examples. The backend needs significant updates to match the exact specifications from the user's images. All other functionality (no duplicates, emoji integration) is working correctly. Main agent should focus on implementing the complete expressions and adjectifs vocabulary as shown in the user's images with proper alphabetical sorting and exact word counts."

Several important translations don't match user's table. ✅ Basic backend functionality working: API connectivity, MongoDB connection, content initialization all functional. ✅ Numbers system (1-20) working perfectly with authentic translations.
